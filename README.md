# Stock Analysis AI Agent

This project leverages CrewAI's Stock Analysis example as a starting point for building an AI-powered stock analysis tool. The initial example from CrewAI provided the foundational framework, which I’ve extended and modified to meet specific project needs.

In this version of the project, I’ve opted to use open-source alternatives to ensure better scalability and flexibility. Instead of relying on proprietary models, I integrated Local LLMs using **Ollama Mistral** embeddings. This enables more efficient and customizable interactions with the stock data, allowing for faster and more cost-effective processing of stock-related queries.
